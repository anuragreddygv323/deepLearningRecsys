# deepLearningRecsys
This repository contains files for the deep learning for recsys hands-on workshop - data science summit Israel 18'. 
We will present two use cases:
## Session based recommendation
## Neural collaborative filtering
Materials for this use case are available at (https://github.com/goolig/neural_collaborative_filtering.git).

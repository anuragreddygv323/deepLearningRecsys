# Session based recommendation
This section includes the materials for the session based recommendation use case.
It is based on our paper "Item Embedding for Session Based Recommendation" https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RIdOKa6DEAW0MdWFcj4JX3pgrcUyigJI

## Installation requirements 
- Python version 3.6 (anaconda installation)  https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- Tensorflow (backend) 
- Keras version 2.1 https://keras.io/
- GloVe (optional) http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
- Recsys 15' challenge dataset http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html (a shorter version is available in this repository)

# Workshop structure
The hands-on exercise includes the following steps:
- Pre-processing 1: train\test, corpus file to GloVe
- GloVe (optional): vocab, vectors files
- Pre-processing 2 (optional):  NN in - sequence format + word embedding, NN out â€“ one hot by vocab
- Model train
- Model test (calc recall@10)
